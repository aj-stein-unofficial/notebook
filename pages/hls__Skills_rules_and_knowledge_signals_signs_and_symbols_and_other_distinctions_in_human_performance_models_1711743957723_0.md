- MA N Y technical systems in modern times are highly automated and do not rely on human intervention in the control of normally planned functions. Yet their existence depends on extensive support from a human staff to maintain the necessary conditions for satisfactory opera tion and to cope with all the badly structured and probably unforeseen states of affairs in the system.

- What we need is not a global quantitative model of human performance but a set of models which is reliable for defined categories of work conditions together with a qualitative framework describing and defining their cover age and relationships.
