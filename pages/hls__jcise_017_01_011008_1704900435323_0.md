- Those leading the efforts to transition communication methods for manufacturing complex products coined the term “digital thread” to convey the data ﬂows between engineering, manufacturing, business processes, and across supply chain

- We developed an open-source Digital Manufacturing Certiﬁcate (DMC) toolkit3 that provides an application programming interface (API) and user interface to embed digital certiﬁcates into four standards-based 3D-model formats.

- In the regulated U.S. aerospace industry, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that aerospace manufacturers to deﬁne a plan and receive FAA approval for managing and maintaining electronic design data (e.g., 3D computer-aided design(CAD) models, digital parts lists) used in the certiﬁcation process

- There are two uses of product data: (1) lateral direction and (2) vertical direction [24]. Lateral direction means using product data within a phase of the product lifecycle. Vertical direction means reusing product data in subsequent product lifecycle phases. PDQ is important to both uses.

- Data-interoperability formats (e.g., JT [26], PDF/PRC [27], and STEP AP242 [6]) address the technology and cost factors. There is also commercial support for quality, but quality is less understood by industry than data interoperability.

- X.509-PMI is less known to end users. X.509-PMI is similar to X.509-PKI, except X.509-PMI is used for authorization. The purpose of X.509-PMI is to manage user authorizations with an attribute authority at the top of a certiﬁcate hierarchy [39]. The attribute authority references an X.509-PKI identity and delegates privileges to the identity based on the assigned privileges from a “source of authority.” The attribute authority issues an“attribute certiﬁcate” that is linked to the identity provided by the X.509-PKI-based certiﬁcate. Adoption of the X.509-PMI in practice has been minimal with only a few commercially available applications.

- In addition to the solution we describe in this paper, we investigated two alternative solutions, which were(1) brokered data-exchange mechanisms(2) cloud-based and software-as-a-service (SaaS) product-data repositories

- brokered data-exchange mechanisms lack support for authentication, authorization, and traceability of product data unless metadata is added explicitly to the data ﬁles stored within the system. Brokered data-exchange mechanisms also require a large user, data, security, and intellectual property (IP) management overhead to ensure users can access only the data each is authorized to use. Finally, with brokered data-exchange mechanisms, there is no control of the product data once the data are downloaded.

- Cloud-based and SaaS solutions require constant connections between client and server systems to ensure that the product data are accessible. This means the systems must remain “online” at all times, which adds a layer of unneeded complexity to interfacing with the product data. In addition, cloud-based and SaaS solutions lack standards support because the technologies are still emerging and do not have widespread industrial support. The lack of standards limits the industrial scalability of the cloud-based and SaaS solutions.

- Backward traceability records information and data on the past history of the product. Forward traceability explains what will happen to a certain product, in terms of operations and processes—this information is written before performing any operation. The last category is active and passive traceability. Active traceability is considered to be online and synchronous, which implies that the data may be “phoning home” to a central server. Passive traceability may be online or ofﬂine and is typically asynchronous. Our method supports all combinations of the traceability categories. The only requirement to using our method for traceability is the availability to validate the attached digital certiﬁcates.

- 3.2 Use Case. Our goal is to demonstrate the beneﬁts of digitally signing product data to support and improve data ﬂows and quality control in a smart-manufacturing environment. Our use case focuses on manufacturing data elements transformations. Smart manufacturing requires digital product information to be available to each of its processes. The model-based paradigm on which smart manufacturing relies often needs product information to be expressed in different formats and processed by different software through the product lifecycle. This results in manipulating and generating variations of master-product models. These variations come from different transformations, either from the master models themselves or from other variations. These variations constitute what we identify as a transformation network, as shown in Fig. 4.
