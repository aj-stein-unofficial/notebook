- Analysis to identify failure modes and associated failure effects starts at the lowest functional level of the asset hierarchy. The effect of a failure mode at a low level can become a failure cause of a higher level component, and these effects are propagated up through the system hierarchy until the ﬁnal failure effect is identiﬁed.

- While their work lacks a real use case it nevertheless provides motivation for this work as they identify their next steps as “auto-population of a knowledge base from CSV format FMEA worksheets”.

- For the FMO, the challenge is to provide deﬁnitions for the vocabulary used in the FMEA process.

- Here, inference aims to (1) ensure consistency in the use of terms and relationships in the FMEA and asset hierarchy spreadsheet tables

- The only ﬁelds we have added to this are (a) one for a FMEA ID, which allows us to uniquely identify each row of the table, and (b) a ﬁeld to indicate if the item is functionally critical or not to the operation of the pressure vessel. If marked as critical then failure of this item will shut down an operating pressure vessel.

- We also explore some more complex cause and effect reasoning, associated with non-critical failures.

- To perform this reasoning, no additional classes are required in the ontology. Instead, reasoning is supported by adding an additional component hierarchy to the ontology.

- After decades of trying to develop ontologies in sector and organisational silos, the engineering community has recognized a need to collaborate, co-create, and share ontologies in order to move forward. Examples include (1) ongoing work by the Norwegian oil and gas sector to produce ontologically consistent Material Master data based on ISO 15926-14, for which parts of the ontology are public (https://github.com/Sirius-sﬁ/aibel-mmdontology), and (2) the formation of the global Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF) consortium and their work-in-progress open-source set of axioms and deﬁnitions for an industrial ontology. Both of these developments adhere to the principles of the BFO top level ontology
