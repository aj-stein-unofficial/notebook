- These included a common language and taxonomies to describe software and software-related weaknesses [4], attack patterns [5] and vulnerabilities [6], [7], avenues for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and exposures [7], [8], entities to coordinate responses between researchers, vendors, and deployers, and approaches to prioritize mitigations [9]

- CVE’s organization is based on the concept of a simple list of identiﬁers for publicly known vulnerabilities. which helps to correlate entries that are referring to or discussing the same issues [12].

- The origin of CWE is derived from working with the real-world examples of the types of vulnerabilities that appear in software applications.

- If an organization is concerned with attacks on speciﬁc weaknesses because of the possible consequences, the relationships between CWEs and CAPECs can be used to identify the likely CAPECs for a CWE and that knowledge can inform the defender on options for mitigation. Table II shows a list of the properties of attack patterns in CAPEC

- . To assist in this work, a public draft of NISTIR 8138, Vulnerability Description Ontology(VDO): A Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities, was created to foster a conversation and collect feedback on the best mechanisms to improve the degree of automation

- While the CVE ecosystem is increasingly capable of usefully characterizing hardware vulnerabilities, there are many hardware speciﬁc attack and weakness concepts that have been already deﬁned in the literature

- For example, the CWE concept “CWE-325: Missing Required Encryption Step” is described as “The software does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by that algorithm.” While this effect could be caused by an inherent software weakness it is often the end result of hardware glitching attacks. The CWE ontology contains the relation “resultant” and CWE-325 in its deﬁnition, can be described by that relation. Thus, CWE contains the concepts and relations to describe the action of a, for example, fault injection attack that causes an encryption algorithm to prematurely dump the plaintext to a recoverable media

- Additionally, version 4.0 saw the introduction of a new “Hardware Design” view, which organizes weaknesses associated speciﬁcally with hardware. In version 4.3, a total of 95 additional hardware weaknesses were added to the CWE, which now are separated into a hardware section on the summary of changes page. However, these updates have not surfaced in CAPEC as of this writing.

- ltimately security estimates must take several factors into account:• Hardware security issues range from remotely accessible vulnerabilities such as Spectre/Meltdown, to counterfeit production, to subversion via fault injection. Therefore, generic security estimation is impossible, and a threat model must be speciﬁed.• Security estimates must take preventative measures into account such as secure design practices, and testing/veriﬁcation.• Hardware has a distinct and complex lifecycle, which begins with multiple layers of design abstraction, and multiple phases of the design process leading to fabrication. Additionally, hardware can be used in multiple environments with various levels of physical security.• Hardware usually consists of integrated components beginning with the inclusion of 3rd party IP at during IC design, to various components on printed circuit boards, and ﬁnally inclusion different hardware into large systems.
