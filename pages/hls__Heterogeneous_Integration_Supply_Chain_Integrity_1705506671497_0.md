- Heterogeneous Integration (HI) was proposed to produce ICs with greater functionality per area and performance by incorporating different dies, known as chiplets, which can contain different functionalities and materials, and process nodes onto another die, known as an interposer in either a 2.5D or 3D packaging scheme [15]. Between the interposer and chiplets are redistribution layers, which contain the interconnections between chiplets. This is defined as2.5D packaging, where the chiplets are all located on the same surface.

- Most blockchain networks for SoC assurance allow supply chain actors to engage in a consortium to enlist or verify information concerning the SoC throughout the supply chain. Depending on the blockchain, different entities are assumed untrusted and have limited permissions. Trusted entities generally have higher permissions to enroll SoC information with the goal of cross referencing that information later to identify counterfeit SoCs.

- Therefore, a root-of-trust chiplet CHSM is required to protect the security assets (cryptographic keys, logic locking keys, unique device ID, protected state control bits, etc.) of the SiP and to prevent information leakage and unauthorized access to the SiP, such as against fault injection attacks.

- During the design phase, the SiP designer designs the CHSM considering the security requirement and design specification of the SiP system, or the SiP designer/trusted assembly procures an existing CHSM from a trusted vendor that satisfies the security requirements. The CHSM chiplet can be implemented in an FPGA platform to be incorporated into a SiP system.

- The CHSM obtains the data securely from the chiplets and transfers them to the nodes using PKI. However, the interconnections among the CHSM and the chiplets are made through the interposer layer, which is vulnerable to probing attacks (Figure 7) and gets exposed to the attacker if not encrypted. To solve this problem, the CHSM must authenticate the chiplets containing the security assets and communicate in a secure fashion.

As can be seen in Figure 8, our framework contains many of the same blockchain elements of our teamâ€™s eChain [42] implementation for providing provenance to SoCs, PCBs, and systems.
