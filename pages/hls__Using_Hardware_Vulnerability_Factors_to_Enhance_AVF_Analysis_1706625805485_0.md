- One step in determining a processor’s compliance to its failure rate target is measuring the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) of each on-chip structure.

- Some faults do not result in an error; these faults are said to be masked. Fault masking in a system can be quantiﬁed using the Architectural Vulnerability Factor, or AVF.

- . In particular, AVF exploits very little of the abstraction that is present in modern computer systems. AVF provides device-level abstraction: it models multiple underlying hardware devices(e.g., SRAMs, latches) as basic memory elements. However, AVF provides for none of the abstractions at the higher levels of the system stack, such as the Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) or Application Binary Interface (ABI), that have been key drivers of modern computer architecture

- Mukherjee et al. introduced the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) and ACE Analysis as a means to estimate a processor’s failure rate from transient faults early in the design cycle [11].

- Other related work includes Seifert and Tam’s Timing Vulnerability Factor (TVF) [16]. TVF quantiﬁes devicelevel fault masking but does not extend to other system layers

- For a fault to cause an error within a given system layer, it must occur within a bit visible to that layer.

- Previous studies have shown that a structure’s AVF increases with its occupancy, leading to a high correlation between AVF and structure occupancy
