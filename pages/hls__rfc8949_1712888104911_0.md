- CBOR is explicit about its generic data model, which deﬁnes the set of all data items that can be represented in CBOR. Its basic generic data model is extensible by the registration of "simple values" and tags.

- Within environments that can represent the data items in the generic data model, generic CBOR encoders and decoders can be implemented (which usually involves deﬁning additional implementation data types for those data items that do not already have a natural representation in the environment).

- Note that integer and ﬂoating-point values are distinct in this model, even if they have the same numeric value

- Also note that serialization variants are not visible at the generic data model level. This deliberate absence of visibility includes the number of bytes of the encoded ﬂoating-point value. It also includes the choice of encoding for an "argument" (see Section 3) such as the encoding for an integer, the encoding for the length of a text or byte string, the encoding for the number of elements in an array or pairs in a map, or the encoding for a tag number.•••[IEEE754]••••• RFC 8949 CBOR December 2020 Bormann & Hoﬀman Standards Track Page 8

- Additional elements of the extended generic data model can be (and have been) deﬁned via the IANA registries created for CBOR.

- In other words, the basic generic data model is stable as deﬁned in this document, while the extended generic data model expands by the registration of new simple values or tag numbers, but never shrinks.

- The speciﬁc data model for a CBOR-based protocol usually takes a subset of the extended generic data model and assigns application semantics to the data items within this subset and its components

- Speciﬁc data models can also specify value equivalency (including values of diﬀerent types) for the purposes of map keys and encoder freedom. For example, in the generic data model, a valid map have both 0 and 0.0 as keys, and an encoder encode 0.0 as an integer(major type 0, Section 3.1). However, if a speciﬁc data model declares that ﬂoating-point and integer representations of integral values are equivalent, using both map keys 0 and 0.0 in a single map would be considered duplicates, even while encoded as diﬀerent major types, and so invalid; and an encoder could encode integral-valued ﬂoats as integers or vice versa, perhaps to save encoded bytes

- An encoder produce only well-formed encoded data items. A decoder return a decoded data item when it encounters input that is not a well-formed encoded CBOR data item

- The initial byte of each encoded data item contains both information about the major type (the high-order 3 bits, described in Section 3.1) and additional information (the low-order 5 bits). With a few exceptions, the additional information's value describes how to load an unsigned integer "argument":

- If the encoded sequence of bytes ends before the end of a data item, that item is not well-formed. If the encoded sequence of bytes still has bytes remaining after the outermost encoded item is decoded, that encoding is not a single well-formed CBOR item
