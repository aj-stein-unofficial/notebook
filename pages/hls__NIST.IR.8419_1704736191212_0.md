- Prior NIST documents treat each supply chain tier as having a “per acquirer” perspective which provides risk analysis context and highlights the challenge of establishing pedigree and provenance across multiple tiers. This document builds on that approach with an ecosystem perspective, and it recognizes the importance of certain acquirers who establish foundational traceability requirements for a subset (ecosystem) of the supply chain.

- Typically, minimal shared traceability data is stored directly on the blockchain, with links to full traceability data stored in off-chain storage. The off-chain storage can be a stakeholder system, or shared storage for the ecosystem, including decentralized storage.

- For example, what are the minimum viable traceability data elements which constitute traceability for any set of goods and services? Present traceability metrics as implemented in the case studies are generally straightforward, meaning either the pedigree/provenance data records for the ecosystem are written and read, or not. Another possible metric of traceability is “time to data,” which measures the speed with which an operator can acquire the information they need about any given product in the moment that the information is needed. Time to data is often a crucial measure of the effectiveness of a supply chain in its ability to deliver information and trust, in addition to physical goods.

- After selecting blockchain to securely record provenance data with entities in their supply chain, Manufacturer X determined that, to truly trust the data on their blockchain, they would need to immutably connect part data to individual products through the use of a unique and unclonable cyber-physical anchor. DUST Identity filled this need through the Diamond Unclonable Security Tag (DUST), which binds physical parts to their unique digital records using a persistent, secure identifier composed of microscopic diamond crystals.

- Auburn University’s RFID Lab conducted a proof of concept targeting challenges of tracking RFID serialized data pertaining to products moving from brand distribution centers to retailers[20]. The proof of concept employed blockchain technologies and included a step to standardize data streams. The GS1 Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) [50] standard allowed data from numerous company systems to post transactions to the blockchain solution. Some participants produced data streams for the EPCIS standard while others relied on an AUdeveloped translator. Among the findings of the proof of concept are opportunities valued at$181 billion associated with claims processing, shrink, and counterfeiting.
