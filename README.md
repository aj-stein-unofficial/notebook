# A.J. Stein's Notebook

Welcome to A.J. Stein's Notebook. This is a collection of notes, research briefs, code snippets, useful links, and data I use for my ongoing work in NIST's Computer Security Division.

# How do I read this?

At this time, so I can cross-link references to saved web pages, PDFs, and other artifacts and annotate them with metadata, I am using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). You will have to download that tool for the relevant platform and import the graph by using [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) to clone this repo *and* its submodules.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:aj-stein-nist/notebook.git
```

Please note that the current submodule, cloned to `assets/` path, contains a variety of PDFs and plugin storage exports that, in a few important cases, I cannot openly share on the Internet. So links to those assets will break, but highlights and notes about can be made available. Please contact me for more details.
