# Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures for Assessment

## Open Questions

- Is the subject, action, and object tuple simple enough to describe the whole of assessment models (especially automated ones)?
- Do we need pre-determined properties of an assessment subject (custom app, container, server, cloud infra) before we assess them?
- Do we need to pre-determine necessary (and mandatory in OSCAL) action details for a rule or can we generalize them?
