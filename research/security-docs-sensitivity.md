# Perceived Sensitivity of Security Documentation and Data

## Open Questions

- What is or is not security documentation? Is there a simple, objective heuristic for this, or is it always subjective?
- How does [the US federal government's CUI Program](https://www.archives.gov/cui) inform the perceived sensitivity of security documentation?
- How does [the US federal government's FOIA Program](https://foia.gov) inform the perceived sensitivity of security documentation?
